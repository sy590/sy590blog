        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I graduated from China Pharmaceutical University and obtained a degree of Economics. Thanks to Sinochem Group, I get a manage assistant job. I worked there for 6 years, I got promoted several times and had a bunch of leadership roles. I also lead different sales team and project teams provided trade service and products for global pharmaceutical and chemical companies. I came to Georgetown because I want to further my education and have a better career development in finance. Last summer, I interned at JUUL labs and supported the global finance department to improve the end to end finance process. Recently, I am working for World Bank Group as a consulting intern and developing a strategy to identify emerging markets for hydrogen storage.
